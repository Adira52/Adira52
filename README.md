- 👋 Hi, I’m @Adira52
- 👀 I’m interested in World of Warcraft addons
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, not much, I am almost 70 and just want to play a game that is challenging and interesting
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much but if you want any life advice just ask but nothing sexist, rascist etc - you know what I mean
- 📫 How to reach me via here I guess since this program is encouraging me to write this ... I really have no idea why I am here except that I am looking for a place to update my addons
